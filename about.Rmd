## Course Description 

This course examines social psychology from a cross-cultural perspective. To what extent is social behaviour different or the same across the world? What theories can we use to understand the thoughts, feelings, actions, and beliefs of people across cultures? Emphasis is on such basic social processes as construction of identity and personality, dimensions of cultural variation, and intergroup harmony and conflict. Issues towards developing cross-cultural competence are considered, with an eye towards establishing better practices for the evolving population of Aotearoa/New Zealand.  

## Religion as a Window into Culture and Behaviour

This year, we will use religion as a window through which to view patterns of cultural variation and similarity. 

From the healing rituals of the Kung people in southern Africa, to the human sacrificial rituals of the Aztecs, to the liberating speeches of Martin Luther King, human spirituality is both diverse and powerful.  What explains the near universality of religion? What explains its diversity of forms? Are religions like typewriters, once useful but now obsolete?  Or will religions remain vital for humanity's future.   Here, we investigate these questions from the perspective of *cultural evolution*.

## Teaching Format

Psyc423 is a 15pt course which represents approx. 150 hours of total work for an average student.

In-class time involves (approx. 22hrs):

  1. Lectures by academic staff (typically Bulbulia): Lectures will introducing basic areas of knowledge, and will supplement the readings.

  2. Class discussions. I expect students to read the assigned articles for the relevant week. To receive participation credit, students must attent seminar and submit a brief (~100 word) account of a thought, question, or insight that occurred to them during the class discussion.

  3. The reports and "grant" assessments are described in [Assessments](https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-423/assessments.html))
  
  4. Note: this course has no tests or examinations.


Out-of-class time involves (approx. 128hrs):

1.	Reading articles before & following class.
2.	Reading materials for the student presentations and writing response papers.
3.	Research project readings & preparation
4.	Research proposal writing


## Mandatory course requirements 

There are no Mandatory course requirements.

## Workload

Given that Psyc 423 is a 15 point course, the expected workload is no less than 150 hours in total. This would mean roughly 15 hours per week. This should be viewed as a minimum - how much you get out of this course will depend on the work you put in.

## Penalties

Students must turn in all assignments on time by due dates. If students do not turn in an essay or assignment at a designated time, they will receive a zero for assignment this will be counted toward the final grade. 


## Materials and equipment and/or additional expenses

You will not be needing any additional equipment or materials.

## Recommended reading 

Most of the material students will be expected to read is published in journals and to some extent in books. Students will need to read between two and five articles per week. Set readings will mostly be supplied throughout the course (please check relevant week in BlackBoard). However, students will also be required to conduct their own independent reviews of the literature for assignment purposes.
