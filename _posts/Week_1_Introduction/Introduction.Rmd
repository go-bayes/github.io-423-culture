## What is culture?


```{r maur1, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("jb.png")
```

We define culture in a broadly to socially transmitted and acquired information information that affects and enables human cognition and behavior. That's not perfect. For example, its clear that birds, chimps, and other organisms have culture, however, this definition makes a start. 

## What is evolution? 


```{r layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap=" From Martin Nowak's Five Rules For The Evolution of Cooperation"}
knitr::include_graphics("nowak.png")
```
We define evolution as a process by which design accumulates in living systems under the following conditions: 

  1. Variation within a population
  2. Competition among variants 
  3. Inheritance such that there is a faithful transmission to "children" of "parental" traits.
  
Here too, we have only an approximate definition to make a start.^[Source of image Martin' Nowak's Five Rules for the Evolution of Cooperatoin [here](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Without-any-mechanism-for-the-evolution-of-cooperation-natural-selection-favors_fig2_6641993)] 


## Why combine culture and evolution? 

When defining evolution we used shutter quotes for "children" and "parents" because evolution is not restricted to biological inheritance. There are evolutionary patterns at the level of culture. 

There are three main benefits for combining culture and evolution:

  1. to clarify otherwise bewildering cultural diversity;
  2. to unlock wisdom in culturally inherited systems;
  3. to avoid to cultural evolved inequality.   
  
## Focus on Religion

### Evolutionary Puzzle 1: religion appears to be biologically costly


```{r   layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap= "What is the Expression on this woman's face? "}
knitr::include_graphics("pain1.png")
```

  
```{r   layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap= "Biological puzzle of costs"}
knitr::include_graphics("pain2.png")
```
  
<aside>
  ```{r  fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Hindu Sadus actively destroy reproductive futures"}
knitr::include_graphics("cost.png")
```
</aside>

### Evolutionary Puzzle 2: Religion is ancient


  ```{r layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Evidence for ritual at least 150kya"}
knitr::include_graphics("rold.png")
```



### Evolutionary Puzzle 3: Religion is pervasive, and growing 


```{r   layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap= "People in the New century will be religious"}
knitr::include_graphics("forcast.png")
```



```{r  layout="l-body-outset",fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Diversity of one mosque: Al Noor (Christchurch"}
knitr::include_graphics("alnoor.png")
```


```{r  layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Highest levels  of religious identification predict more children"}
knitr::include_graphics("chrel.png")
```

### Religion in your backyard


```{r  layout="l-body-outset",fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Places of faith in Wellington"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_wl.png")
```


```{r  layout="l-body-outset",fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Places of faith in Upper Hutte"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_hutt.png")
```


```{r  layout="l-body-outset",fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Places of faith in Upper Hutte"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_petone.png")
```



```{r  layout="l-body-outset",fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Diversity of one mosque: Al Noor (Christchurch"}
knitr::include_graphics("alnoor.png")
```

## How will this course benefit me? 

  1. Knowledge of cultural evolutionary theory and research
  2. Presentation skills
  2. Critical sympathetic writing.
  3. Skills for organising a research idea, and pitching it to a potential funder.
