## Definition of Religion 

In this course we stipulate a meaning for “religion” as beliefs and practices regarding the supernatural. 

## Methodological naturalism

We will not assume the existence of any supernatural being (e.g. Zeus) when explaining beliefs and practices regarding supernatural beings (e.g. Greek religion).  

Methodological naturalism is a useful assumption: it has led to scientific progress.

However, methodological naturalism does not imply atheism. It is an assumption, not a result. 


## The principle of consistency

We can be held accountable to our beliefs. 

For example: 

* You believe that Abel Tasman is south of Wellington 
* You believe that maps can be trusted.
* You look up Abel Tasman at 40.9347° S
* You look up Wellington at 41.2865° S
* Your beliefs are inconsistent

## The cognitive revolution 

**Key idea: thinking is a kind of *information processing*.**

  - Cognitive scientists claim that both the brain and computers need to be approached abstractly and from a non-materialist point of view. 
  - Thinking (and computers) involves transforming information through symbolic representation according to rules
  - Implication: to understand thinking requires understanding rules (not neurons or any other material “stuff”)

```{r  light, layout="l-body-outset",  out.width = "1000px", fig.cap = "We perceive color constancy under different lightening condition, even as light frequencies vary. The algorthims that perform the transformations are a feature of our biological endowment."}
knitr::include_graphics("light.png")
```


```{r  eyelight, layout="l-body-outset",  out.width = "1000px", fig.cap = "There are constraints on processing: the eyes in both images (left/right) reflecting at the same frequency of light, but we process the colours as different."}
knitr::include_graphics("eyelight.png")
```
## Language as mental organ

Consider the following sentences:

* John saw Mary with Alice.
* John saw Mary and Alice.

We can create questions: of this form 

* With whom did John see Mary?

But never of this form: 
* And whom did John see Mary?

The rule: "No conjuct may be moved" appears to be a human universal. Children never learn such a rule. 

(See: Ross, J.R. 1967. Constraints on variables in syntax. Doctoral dissertation, MIT (published as 'Infinite syntax!' Ablex, Norwood (1986)


The coordinate structure constraint: children never make the mistake in red sentence.  Generally speaking, the class of all learnable grammars occupies a narrow bandwidth on the spectrum of possibility.

## Travelling salesperson problems


What is the shortest path bewtween 10 New Zealand cities?  If we attempt the calculation by brute force, we end up with the the following:


```{r echo = TRUE}
# The equation is 
# (n-1)!/2 
factorial(9)/2
```

It only takes counting paths between ~ 60 towns to arrive at the number of atoms in the universe.

```{r echo = TRUE}
# The equation is 
# (n-1)!/2 
factorial(60)/2
```

<aside>
```{r  maps, layout="l-body-outset",  out.width = "1000px", fig.cap = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("maps.jpg")
```
</aside>

For what appear to be simple tasks, the mind/brain quickly runs up against mathematical limits for information processing.
