## Introduction

> If I have exhausted the justifications, I have reached bedrock and my spade is turned. Then I am inclined to say: 'This is simply what I do’.”
> ― Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations

You have all sorts of beliefs. How do you know which, if any, are true? 

This puzzle has animated the thoughts of philosophers, story-tellers, and skeptics throughout the ages.  

For it would seem that any answer we might give will be prone to further questioning: “how do you know that?”


## Overview

Developmental psychology is focused on the emergence of psychological capacities and knowledge during childhood and adolescence.  As we shall see, the how religion develops in children and adults may be used to assess theories about religion operates in adults, and whether religion performs is commonplace because it fosters biological success. 

First, we will look at a study from Harris’s group at Harvard considering evidence that children are biased to learn from parents and trusted care givers.  Harris and colleagues argue that biased cultural transmission from parents to offspring leads to the propagation of religion over time. 

Thne we will turn to evidence that children acquire religion very rapidly without active transmission from parents and trusted authorities.  A relatively automatic development of religious beliefs would be consistent with the prediction of cognitive theories of religion, which hold that religion grows like an organ of the body grows – with internal feature of its design largely in place.  The studies we consider focusing on internal development with cover three generic structures of belief:

1. "Promiscuous" Teleology: tendencies to perceive intentions and designs throughout nature.
2. Intuitive Theism: tendencies to perceive creators who intended to design nature
3. Intuitive Dualism: tendency to think of the world as part material and partly immaterial. 

At the end of the lecture, I’ll ask you to listen to a interviews from Justin Barrett and Jesse Bering, who will connect the developmental literature to the theory that religion is an adaptation that evolved to promote individual survival and reproduction




## Trust in Testimony

To formulate beliefs requires trusting others.  This is because lots of what we trust we cannot observe first-hand. 

Examples:

- Brain: By the age of 5 – 6 years, children understand that the brain is a prerequisite for mentation.

- Shape of earth”: by 8-9 years old ~ half (47%) of children adopt a spherical model and less than 10% think of the earth as a flattened sphere. This pattern pattern holds cross-culturally.

- Hidden body organs” similar story

- God: “Despite their paradoxical nature, religious claims about the extraordinary powers of special beings such as God are readily transmitted to young children and understood by them. Children recog-nize that God is extraordinary not just with respect to his cognitive powers but also with respect to his life cycle."

- Afterlife: 

Harris and Koenig write: 

> The questions were posed in two different contexts: a secular context involving a medically oriented narrative and a nonsecular context involving a religiously oriented narrative. In line with the results obtained by Bering and his colleagues (Be- ring, 2002; Bering & Bjorklund, 2004), children in both age groups were more likely to make disconti- nuity judgments for biological as compared to mental processes. In addition, however, children’s replies varied sharply with narrative context. In the secular context, they were likely to assert that most functioning ceases at death and to offer a biological justification. In the religious context, by contrast, they were likely to assert that functioning continues after death and to offer a religious justification. Moreover, this context sensitivity was more evident among older than younger children


## Promiscuous Teleology 

Deb Kelemen has argued that beyond mere facility with supernatural agent concepts, children are “intuitive theists” who explain much of their world through supernatural concepts

Kelemen points to converging bodies of research suggesting children are biased to reason about the natural world in terms of intentions and purpose: "promiscuous teleology"

With respect to promiscuous teleological intuitions, when prompted to respond to the question “what is this X  for?” American 4–5 year olds find the question appropriate not only to body parts and artefacts, but also to living things.  A lions if for children “to go in the zoo”.



### Promiscuous Teleology holds for other aspects of the nature such as objects  

This effect non-biological natural kinds like clouds (“for raining”). Moreover when asked whether raining is what a cloud “does” or what it is “made for,” pre-schoolers favour explanations that natural entities are “made for something” and that is their reason for being here (Kelemen 1999). Kelemen has shown that rampant teleology endures well into elementary school, especially with respect to object properties, with the teleological biases only beginning to moderate at age 9–10.


When asked to perform a “science” task and decide whether ancient rocks were pointy because “bits of stuff piled up for a long period of time” (i.e. a physical process) children preferred “self-survival” functions like “so that animals wouldn’t sit on them and smash them” and “artefact” functions like “so that animals could scratch on them when they got itchy” (Kelemen 1999). This bias to favour teleolo- gical explanation for non-living as well as living natural object properties persists even when children are told that adults employ physical explana- tions, a pattern also observed in British children (Kelemen 2003). 

### Cross Cultural pattern observed both for promiscuous teleology and explanations of origins

Kelemen and her colleagues observe evidence for Teleological response across different obtain domains is not unique to Western cultures, but also holds among Chinese Children.

What is going on here? 

It looks as though children take a design stance towards nature: Teleological explanations appear to reflect a deep-rooted natural bias to view elements of the world having specific purpose

### Children and beliefs in creators

So far we have been describing teleological reasoning in children – the tendency to ascribe functions and purposes to nature, in the absence of any evidence for such functions.  

The work of Margret Evans helps to clarify how these effects apply to religion. Evans find  that regardless of the religious affiliations of their parents, children exhibit a bias for intentional accounts (Evans 2000; Evans 2001). That is to say, children do not merely ascribe functions and purposes to objects, the tend to infer that agents of some kind creates the stuff of nature, both animate and inanimate. 

For example when asked: “how do you think the very first sun-bear got here on earth?” 8–10 year olds from both fundamentalist and non-fundamentalist American homes favour creationist accounts, namely that “god made it” over other teleological accounts “a person made it” or non- teleological accounts, “it just happened.” 

5–7 year olds exhibit the same explanatory bias for both animate and inanimate objects. 

Thus, according to Evans, children view non-artefact items and events of the world as caused by supernatural agents

## Intuitive Creationists

It is only among 11–13 year old non-fundamentalist children that patterns of divergence emerge. 

Gelman and Kremer have found that children prefer to explain the existence of remote natural items (like oceans) as made by God (Gelman and Kremer 1991).  A similar result has been observed among British children (Petrovich 1997). 

It appears that while children identify people as the designing agents of artefacts, they distinguish god as the designing agent of nature (Kelemen and DiYanni 2002). 

Recall that Harris attributed believes in a creator God to the trusting testimony of adults. Harris actually cites Evan’s study, but he points out that there is variation among the degree to which children in non-religious households ascribe creator beliefs to the world. Yet what Harris fails to find amazing is that even in children who are not explicitly told to believe, or who are explicitly told not to believe, we find a persistence of creationist beliefs. 

Given that parents actually prefer non-teleological explanations, the child’s promiscuous teleology remains difficult to explicate in terms of social acquisition. 

Kids are do not appear to be getting beliefs from parents. 


## Intuitive dualism: Religion as an artefact of Theory of Mind (ToM)

Some researchers hypothesize that our tendency to form strong beliefs in Gods are the by-product of how social intelligence is, at its most basic levels, configured. 

A central feature of human cognition is our capacity to richly represent the beliefs, goals, and emotions of others. 

We imagine other minds effortless, rapidly, and from impoverished  Cognitive scientists refer to this inferential capacity as "theory of mind" (ToM). They use the term “theory” because such representations possess a richness that is not found in perceptual evidence: intentional representations require attributing to others internal and abstract mental properties – beliefs, desires, goals. Notably, the capacity for ToM emerges early in childhood without clearly structured learning environments (Bloom, 2004; Spelke, Phillips, & Woodward, 1995). 

While ToM operates largely automatically — for example, ToM is triggered from animal-like movements (Scholl & Tremoulet, 2000) —the faculty’s later developmental properties permit rich meta-reflective representations. Such meta-representations are of the kind that enables Alice to infer that Bob wants Carol to persuade Donald to imagine how Esther would feel in Frank’s shoes.  No other lineage remotely approaches humans in this capacity to represent other minds.  Similar to language, theory of mind, presents, with systematic regularities, cross-culturally (Barrett, Todd, Miller, & Blythe, 2005; Cohen, 2007). The majority of every human population manifests theory of mind abilities. In their core properties, such capacities remain invariant.

ToM capacities are also venerable to selective impairment (Baron-Cohen, 1995; Tager-Flusberg, 2005).  Such impairments, too, appear to be distributed in all human populations along a spectrum ranging from autism (deficient ToM) to schizophrenia (excessive ToM)(Crespi & Badcock, 2008; Crespi, Stead, & Elliot, 2009). Collectively, these data suggest strong genetic scaffolding for the capacities to assume what Daniel Dennett calls the "intentional stance" (Dennett, 1991).

Important for our purposes is the finding that humans tend to view intentional representations as qualitatively distinct from material properties (Bloom, 2004). Evolutionary psychologists of religion hypothesise that the same capacities that enable the intentional stance also suppresses judgments of others as governed by mechanistic causality (Bering &  Parker, 2006; Bloom, 2004; Slingerland, 2008). The folk dualism hypothesis for religiosity holds that it is in virtue of ToM that humans automatically project a dualistic picture of mind and matter: perceiving supernatural realms arises from a cognitive default to represent minds as ghosts. Our tendency to divide the world into minds and matter presents much like colour vision, vertigo, and the taste of salt: folk dualism can only be suppressed, if at all, with cognitive effort (Bering & Parker, 2006; Bloom, 

2004). On this model, dualism does not owe to the philosophical legacy of Descartes or Plato, but rather arrives from panhuman genetic endowment:  we are born to believe in ghosts.

For evidence that a robust mind-body dualism characterises even supposedly "holistic" cultures such as early China, see: (Slingerland & Chudek, 2011).


### Justin Barrett's preparedness hypothesis

Barrett et al. have point out that children before the age of five reason easily about god-like beings, before they have developed robust folk psychological powers (Barrett and Richert 2003). 

The authors presented children between the ages of 3–8 with nonhuman agent puppets: a kitty cat, a monkey, and a little girl named “Maggie.”

Children were told that of these puppets, the kitty cat has a special power for seeing things in the dark. Children were then shown a darkened box and asked to report what they saw inside. All children reported they could see nothing. After, illumination of the box revealed it to contain a red block. The children were then asked what each of the puppets would see if they were to look inside the darkened box. Pre-schoolers reported that Maggie would be able to see the contents of the box. 

At age 5, children reasoned correctly that Maggie as well as the monkey would not be able to see the block. Older children however reasoned that only the kitty cat could see the block. This is consistent with developmental studies suggesting that recursive mental state attributions (X doesn’t know that Y knows that P) do not appear until after pre-school. 

However, children at all ages reported that God would see the block. This supports the idea that children do not reason about God as just another person but rather as a different type of agent with nonhuman properties. On the author’s view “children may be better prepared to conceptualize the properties of God than for understanding 
humans” (p. 60). 

Importantly, the authors do not ascribe adaptive significance to this developmental feature: gods are easier to conceptualize because god- concepts require less computational power than ordinary agent concepts do (like ascriptions of false belief.) Nevertheless, it is startling that the first agent concepts children apparently acquire are of gods, which they then apply to persons, whom they endow with familiar god-like powers such as omni- science and omnipotence. These experiments suggest that very early in cognitive development, children easy grasp with rich inferential understandings the meaning of supernatural agent concepts. 

### Afterlife Beliefs: Bering, J. M., & Bjorklund, D.F. (2004)

* PARTICIPANTS
children aged 4-12

* DESIGN
Puppet show: little mouse (various states) being eaten by a grumpy alligator.

* METHODOLOGY: 

Questions: Now that the mouse is dead did....
  - it miss its Mum?
  - Was it still hungry?
  - Was it still angry at its brother?
  - Could it still taste the grass it ate right before it died?

#### Findings

The younger the child, the more likely he/she was to endow the dead mouse with the capacity to experience various mental states...
despite the fact that even pre-schoolers generally understood that the mouse’s body had stopped functioning after death.

This study has been replicated with similar results (religious vs secular children) in Spain.

Bering, J. M., Hernández-Blasi, C., Bjorklund, D. F. (2005). The development of ‘afterlife’ beliefs in secularly and religiously schooled children. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 23, 587-607.


Interest:  Bering finds that over the age of 5, though critically not before, children explain random events in nature as caused by invisible agents. 

This result supports the claim that recursive theory of mind ability actually enhances the domain of supernatural explanation. 

However Bering thinks the persistence of belief arises because it religous beliefs fosters biological success. We'll return to this idea in the weekes ahead.
