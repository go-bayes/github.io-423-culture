To what extent is social behaviour different or the same across the world? What theories can we use to understand the thoughts, feelings, actions, and beliefs of people across cultures? Emphasis is on such basic social processes as construction of identity and personality, dimensions of cultural variation, and intergroup harmony and conflict. Issues towards developing cross-cultural competence are considered, with an eye towards establishing better practices for the evolving population of Aotearoa/New Zealand.\nAssessments\nSee: Assessments\nReligion as a Window into Culture and Behaviour\nThis year, we will use religion as a window through which to view patterns of cultural variation and similarity.\nFrom the healing rituals of the Kung people in southern Africa, to the human sacrificial rituals of the Aztecs, to the liberating speeches of Martin Luther King, human spirituality is both diverse and powerful. What explains the near universality of religion? What explains its diversity of forms? Are religions like typewriters, once useful but now obsolete? Or will religions remain vital for humanity’s future. Here, we investigate these questions from the perspective of cultural evolution.\nSee our church_Map\nCommunication of additional information and submissions\nLectures will be posted to: https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-423/\nCourse-Related notices will appear on VUW Blackboard\nAny information relating to Psyc 423 or any last-minute changes to the course will be posted on Blackboard.\nStudents must submit all written work to VUW Blackboard.\nImportant dates\nTrimester dates: 22 February to 20 June Teaching dates: 22 February to 28 May\nMid-trimester break: 5 April to 18 April\nLast assessment item due: Final assessment (research proposal) will need to be submitted on 31st May see: Assessments\nStudy Examination/Assessment Period: Note: students who enrol in courses with examinations must be able to attend an examination at the University at any time during the scheduled examination period. Withdrawal dates: Refer to Withdrawing If you cannot complete an assignment or sit a test or examination (aegrotats), refer to Aegrotats\nTeaching Format\nPsyc423 is a 15pt course which represents approx. 150 hours of total work for an average student.\nIn-class time involves (approx. 22hrs):\nLectures by academic staff (typically Bulbulia): Lectures will introducing basic areas of knowledge, and will supplement the readings.\nClass discussions. I expect students to read the assigned articles for the relevant week. To receive participation credit, students must attent seminar and submit a brief (~100 word) account of a thought, question, or insight that occurred to them during the class discussion.\nThe reports and “grant” assessments are described in Assessments)\nNote: this course has no tests or examinations.\nOut-of-class time involves (approx. 128hrs):\nReading articles before & following class.\nReading materials for the student presentations and writing response papers.\nResearch project readings & preparation\nResearch proposal writing\nMandatory course requirements\nThere are no Mandatory course requirements.\nWorkload\nGiven that Psyc 423 is a 15 point course, the expected workload is no less than 150 hours in total. This would mean roughly 15 hours per week. This should be viewed as a minimum - how much you get out of this course will depend on the work you put in.\nPenalties\nStudents must turn in all assignments on time by due dates. If students do not turn in an essay or assignment at a designated time, they will receive a zero for assignment this will be counted toward the final grade.\nMaterials and equipment and/or additional expenses\nYou will not be needing any additional equipment or materials.\nRecommended reading\nMost of the material students will be expected to read is published in journals and to some extent in books. Students will need to read between two and five articles per week. Set readings will mostly be supplied throughout the course (please check relevant week in BlackBoard). However, students will also be required to conduct their own independent reviews of the literature for assignment purposes.\nOther important information\nThe information above is specific to this course. There is other important information that students must familiarise themselves with, including:\nAcademic Integrity/Plagiarism\nAcademic Progress\nDates and deadlines\nFaculty of Science Student and Academic Services Office\nGrades\nSpecial passes Refer to the Assessment Handbook\nStatutes and policies\nStudent support\nStudents with disabilities\nStudent Charter\nTerms and Conditions\nTurnitin\nUniversity structure\nVUWSA\nTopics and Readings\nWeek 1: Overview\nWeek 2: Evolutionary Psychology\nCosmides, Leda, and John Tooby. “Evolutionary psychology: A primer.” (1997).
