The course culminates with an in-depth project called "The Grant" in which students develop a grant proposal for conducting original research. Effective grant-writing requires a command of the relevant science, concision, clarity, and imagination.

I'll devote a segment of the course to teaching you what I have learned following the Heilmeier Catechism (see below.) Stay tuned here for mor details

Initial proposal due MIDNIGHT APRIL 24 = 15%
Final Grant due MIDNIGHT 31 MAY = 35% 


#### The Heilmeier Catechism

  1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no
jargon. What is the problem?  Why is it hard?
  2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
  3. What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?
  4. Who cares?
  5. If you’re successful, what difference will it make? What applications are enabled as a result?
  6. What are the risks?
  7. How much will it cost?
  8. How long will it take?
  9. What are the midterm and final “exams” to check for success? How will progress be measured?
