###  Appendix 1: The Heilmeier Catechism

  1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no
jargon. What is the problem?  Why is it hard?
  2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
  3. What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?
  4. Who cares?
  5. If you’re successful, what difference will it make? What applications are enabled as a result?
  6. What are the risks?
  7. How much will it cost?
  8. How long will it take?
  9. What are the midterm and final “exams” to check for success? How will progress be measured?
